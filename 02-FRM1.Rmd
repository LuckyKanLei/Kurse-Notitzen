# FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT I {#FRM1}

Integrated risk management of flood events requires complex,
trans-disciplinary approaches. The module focuses on the relevant
physical processes of flood risks for a comprehensive risk analysis.

## Framework of Integrated Flood Risk Management

This section is based on the lecture "A Framework of Integrated Flood
Risk Management"[@S-FRM1-0].

### Basic terms

A flood is a **temporary** covering of land by water outside its
**normal confines**.(FLOODsite-Consortium 2009)

**Typology**

*Type of flood* (site):

-   Plain floods
-   Flash floods
-   Estuarial floods
-   Coastal floods
-   Pluvial floods

*Cause of event*:

-   Cyclone rainfall floods
-   Snowmelt floods
-   Sea surge and tidal floods
-   Urban sewer floods
-   Dam break or reservoir control floods

from "Flood Protection" towards "**Flood Risk Management**"

Defination: The paradigm change is based on the recognition that
absolute flood protection is unachievable and unsustainable, because of
high costs and inherent uncertainties.

Flood risk is understood as probability of **negative consequences** due
to floods and can only be reduced to a tolerable level.

Flood risk management considers all relevant processes of the **flood
hazard** and the **flood vulnerability** to govern flood risks.

Risk = **probability** \* (negativ) consequence [not certainly]

Flood risk = flood hazard \* (exposure) \* flood vulnerability

vulnerability = value/function \* susceptibility \* coping capacity

Risk = f(Hazard, Vulnerability)

**Flood hazard** A **physical** event, phenomenon or human activity with
the potential to result in harm. A hazard does not necessarily lead to
harm.

Hazards are normally described as the **probability** of flood events
with a certain magnitude and other features.

**Flood vulnerability** Characteristic of a system that describes its
**potential to be harmed**. It covers physical, social, economic,
ecological and institutional aspects.

Areas of Vulnerability direct / indirect tangible / intangible

### Main causal relations within the flood risk system

Source $\rightarrow$ pathway $\rightarrow$ receptor $\rightarrow$
consequence

Flood risk = f(f~source~(probability, features), f~pathway~(inundation,
attributes), f~receptor~(susceptibility), f~consequence~(value, coping
capacity))

### Task and components of flood risk management

![](fig/FRM1/task.JPG)

Bild aus Schatze [@S-FRM1-0].

Flood risk management = **analysis** + **evaluation** + **reduction**

Hazard analysis: **Quantification** of magnitude and other features.

Vulnerability analysis: **Quantification and qualification** of
potential adverse social, economic and ecological impacts due to
flooding.

Risk determination: Methofology to caculate the nature and extent of
flood risk.

Evaluating risk: **Methods** of tolerability aversion, sustainability
and so forth depending on individual or collective interest, values and
aims.

Evaluating risk reduction: Individual measures and instruments in terms
of their intended performance and their relation to side-effects.

Pre-flood risk reduction: Measures and instruments including their
operationalisation for modeling resulting risks ex ante and the planning
and implementation process.

Flood event risk reduction:

Post-flood risk reduction:

### Means and Extremes

variability

-   Spatial variability: smaller (regional and local) variability
    dominates; influences of orography, exposure to general circulation
    pattern and influence of temperature (latitude).

-   Time variability: Periodic cahnges (e.g. seasonal cycle); Aperiodic
    changes (e.g. short events $\rightarrow$ high intensity)

-   Precipitation extremes: frequency and probability

#### Recurrence interval:

Pe: exceedence probability

Pc: cumulative probability, Pc = 1 - Pe

T: Return period, T = 1/Pe, indicates the expected number of years that
need to be considered to find the value of the variable in study.

TU: The upper confidence of return periods can be found respectively as:
TU = 1/(1-U)

TL: The lower confidence of return periods can be found respectively as:
TL = 1/(1-L)

#### Rainfall Distribution in context

Stratiform Precipitation:

Low indensity, long lasting (\> 6h), wide spread $\rightarrow$ pre-event
moisture

Convective Precipitation:

High intensity (Starkregen \> 17 mm/h, Wolkenbruch \> 60 mm/h), short
duration (\> 6 h), small scale $\rightarrow$ flash floods

Starkniederschlag:

![](fig/FRM1/strakregen.png)

#### Statistics of precipitation extremes

Basic: long-term series of mearsured precipitation (30 a not enough, if
possible 100 a or more)

Example for constructing:

1.  Sorting the serices (Max $\rightarrow$ Min) per year
2.  Selection of the maxima of each year
3.  Result: a series of annual precipitation maxima
4.  Adaptation of theoretical distribution of extremes (Gumbel) to the
    measured precipitation series by regession

### Climate Change

Background: Green House Effect

GHG(Green house gases):CO~2~, CH~4~, N~2~O, O~3~, FCCH, etc.

Main excepted characterisics

-   Sea level rise

-   Higher temperatures - espesisally on land

-   Hydrological cycle more intense

-   Changes at regional level can differ (but hard to tell)

#### Extreme precipitation

1.  Statistical approach: Probability distribution fitted to the full
    data sample used instead
2.  design precipitation, SHP(D, T) = height(duration, return)

### Snow

Snow parameters:

-   snow cover duration

-   snow cover time

-   continuance of the longst snow cover period (winter cover)

-   beginning (date) of the maximum snow vover depth

-   constancy of the snow cover

-   retention of the winter cover

-   maximum value of the water euivalent of the snow cover

Regionales Klimamodell (RCM) $\rightarrow$ Wasserhaushaltmodell (WHM)

### Modern weather forecast

-   Computer based caculation of time-dependent change (prognosis) of
    all relevant atmospheric quantities (wind, temperature, humidity,
    density, pressure)

-   Solving of a system of non-linear differential equations including
    the above mentioned quantities

-   Computer simulation satrts with predescribed innitial conditions,
    and the caculation ends with one final solution (deterministic
    model)

### Types and temporal ranges of weather forecast

-   Nowcasting: Next two hours, onlky use of observations (e.g.,
    tracking algorithms for echoes in radar images), without
    representation of atmospheric physics, e.g., assumption of
    persistence

-   Short-range: 18-24 hours, daily weather

-   Medium-range: 3-10 days, weather for the week ahead

-   Long-range: \> 10 days, further outlook; Comparison of cumulative
    precipitation forecast of one simulation for different models
    $\rightarrow$ measure of uncertainty
