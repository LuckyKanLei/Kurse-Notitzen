# FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT I {#FRM1}

Integrated risk management of flood events requires complex, trans-disciplinary approaches. The module focuses on the relevant physical processes of flood risks for a comprehensive risk analysis.

## Framework of Integrated Flood Risk Management

This section is based on the lecture "A Framework of Integrated Flood Risk Management"[@S-FRM1-0].

### Basic terms

A flood is a **temporary** covering of land by water outside its **normal confines**.(FLOODsite-Consortium 2009)

**Typology**

*Type of flood* (site):

- Plain floods
- Flash floods
- Estuarial floods
- Coastal floods
- Pluvial floods

*Cause of event*:

- Cyclone rainfall floods
- Snowmelt floods
- Sea surge and tidal floods
- Urban sewer floods
- Dam break or reservoir control floods

from “Flood Protection” towards “**Flood Risk Management**”

Defination:
The paradigm change is based on the recognition that absolute flood protection is unachievable and unsustainable, because of high costs and inherent uncertainties. 

Flood risk is understood as probability of **negative consequences** due to floods and can only be reduced to a tolerable level.

Flood risk management considers all relevant processes of the **flood hazard** and the **flood vulnerability** to govern flood risks.

Risk = **probability** * (negativ) consequence [not certainly]

Flood risk = flood hazard * (exposure) * flood vulnerability

vulnerability = value/function * susceptibility * coping capacity

Risk = f(Hazard, Vulnerability)

**Flood hazard**
A **physical** event, phenomenon or human activity with the potential to result in harm. A hazard does not necessarily lead to harm.

Hazards are normaly described as the **probability** of flood events with a certain magnitude and other features.

**Flood vulnerability**
Characteristic of a system that describes its **potential to be harmed**.
It covers physical, social, economic, ecological and institutional aspects.

Areas of Vulnerability
direct / indirect
tangible / intangible

### Main causal relations within the flood risk system

Source \rightarrow pathway \rightarrow receptor \rightarrow consequence

Flood risk = f(f~source~(probability, features), f~pathway~(inundation, attributes), f~receptor~(susceptibility), f~consequence~(value, coping capacity))

Flood risk management = analysis + evaluation + reduction

Hazard analysis: Quantification of magnitude and other features.

Vulnerability analysis: Quantification and qualification of potential adverse social, economic and ecological impacts due to flooding.

Risk determination: Methofology to caculate the nature and extent of flood risk.

Evaluating risk: Methods of tolerability aversion, sustainability and so forth depending on individual or collective interest, values and aims.

Evaluating risk reduction: Individual measures and instruments in terms of their intended performance and their relation to side-effects.

Pre-flood risk reduction: Measures and instruments including their operationalisation for modeling resulting risks ex ante and the planning and implementation process.
